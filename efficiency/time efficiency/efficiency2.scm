;Let's estimate the efficiency of the following algorithm (in terms of time): insertion sort
;Tip: it's better to thing about the worst case when estimating the running time of an algorithm

;time taken on the worst scenario (numbers in descending order) for the above algorithm is: N(4 + (7N)/2 + 5) + 2 = (7NÂ²)/2 + 9N + 2 
;obs: we usually don't care about constant factors in the function that tells us the running time of an algoritm

;Obs: in functional programming we don't change the value of anything. We don't use data structures, for example.
;     What we do is to simply write functions that will take inputs and produce an output without changing the value of anything.
