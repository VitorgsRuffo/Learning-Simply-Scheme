;generalizing the pattern: by analysing the two functions above we notice
;that that only thing different between them is the aÂ²/aÂ³ on the else part
;of the if statement. So we can create a generalized function that takes a
;function that calculates the square or cube.

(define (square x)
  (* x x))

(define (cube x)
  (* x x x))

(define (sum fn a b)
  (if (> a b)
      0
      (+ (fn a) (sum fn (+ a 1) b) )))

(sum square 5 6) ;functions as data
